#### Requirements : 
We need specific package versions for the setup of our virtual environment for the project.</br>
Link for the requirements : [here](https://github.com/vardhan-siramdasu/Indicwiki-internship/blob/main/requirements.txt)

## Domain : INDIAN COMPANIES
There more than 2 Million+ companies exist in India. Our aim is to generate articles for 50000+ companies in Telugu so that we divided the companies into 4 categories based on their nature and organization. 

* [*BSE & NSE Companies*](#bsense)
* [*Public Sector Undertakings (PSU)*](#psu)
* [*Companies in Wikipedia*](#wiki)
* [*Other Indian Companies*](#60k)

### BSE & NSE Companies
The BSE SENSEX (also known as the S&P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index or simply SENSEX) is a free-float market-weighted stock market index of 30 well-established and financially sound companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

### Companies in Wikipedia
There are several Indian companies present in wikipedia and most of them are common in BSE & NSE, PSU companies. wiki companies are those which are not present in above 2 categories.

<div id='60k'></div>

### Other Indian Companies
We scraped several websites and collected 60000+ companies data based on their capital. 

## Data collection & Scraping
Most of the scraping part is done using `selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`.</br>
For the installation use the following commands in your command prompt or anaconda prompt.

``` 
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install selenium 
```

## Translation and Transliteration
Translation and Transliteration was an important part of the project. We need to test several packages like `deep-translator`, `anuvaad` and `deeptranslit`. The translator may be works well for some kind of data, so that we need to use the best fit for our data.
For installation of above packages run the following commands in your command prompt or anaconda prompt.

```
pip install deep-translator
pip install anuvaad
pip install deeptranslit
```


## Jinja Templating
We use Jinja templating tool for the creating articles in Telugu. We use randomized the sentence formation to maku sure that each article has different kind of sentenses.</br>
Jinja templates for all four categories of companies :
* BSE & NSE companies : [here](https://github.com/vardhan-siramdasu/Indicwiki-internship/blob/main/indian%20companies%20bse%20nse/templates/company.j2)

* other companies : [here](https://github.com/vardhan-siramdasu/Indicwiki-internship/blob/main/templates/remaining%20Indian%20companies.j2)



## Article(XML) Generation
We generated 4 different XML files for each of the category.</br>
